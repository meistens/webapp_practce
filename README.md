webapp practice

apparently, need to do this to better understand how whatever I am building can be used properly without some major issues that may arise. This will help me to better understand how to use the webapp in a more efficient and effective way.

So, the frontend code are mostly copy-pasta (like we all do, except I make zero effort trying to understand what I'm doing on this front since I got zero interest in frontend stuff...might look for some framework or something to do something if I need to show them data visually...)

*Note: okay, learnt mysql can be tiresome to use, seeing the appeal for other db like firebase, etc. but the frontend thing is also a pain in the ass, so I'm gonna leave it for now.
never cared for it, never will...
