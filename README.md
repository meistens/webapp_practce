webapp practice

apparently, need to do this to better understand how whatever I am building can be used properly without some major issues that may arise. This will help me to better understand how to use the webapp in a more efficient and effective way.

So, the frontend code are mostly copy-pasta (like we all do, except I make zero effort trying to understand what I'm doing on this front since I got zero interest in frontend stuff...might look for some framework or something to do something if I need to show them data visually...)

*Note: gonna take a while updating, don't wanna clutter machine with packages since I plan on running some stuff like dbs and such in a container.
and apparently i have to familiarize myself with dbeaver and psql commands - and write up scripts for cmds I will be using instead of spending half an hour trying to figure shii out to the point I'm getting flagged as a bot (cli is nice, but sometimes gui is better, especially for complex queries, and sometimes it's just easier to visualize data in a GUI)
